# Stream Video Flask

## Project Overview

This project is a Flask application designed to stream video content. It leverages the Flask framework and possibly OpenCV for video processing. 

## Features

* **Video Streaming:** The application is capable of streaming video files or live video feeds from a camera.
* **Web Interface:** A web interface built using HTML templates allows users to access and control the video streaming functionality.

## Installation

1. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate 
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the Flask application:**
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
   This will start the development server, typically accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

2. **Access the web interface:**
   Open the address specified in the terminal (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`) in your web browser.
